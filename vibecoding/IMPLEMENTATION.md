## How It Works

### Editing Flow

1. User types markdown in the editor
2. MarkdownHighlighter provides real-time syntax highlighting
3. Text changes trigger PreviewWidget update
4. PreviewWidget converts markdown to HTML
5. HTML is rendered in QWebEngineView
6. Both panes stay synchronized

### File Operations

1. User opens file via menu or file browser
2. MainWindow loads file content into editor
3. Editor displays content with syntax highlighting
4. Preview updates automatically
5. Changes can be saved back to file

### Folder Navigation

1. User opens folder via File â†’ Open Folder
2. FileBrowser updates to show folder contents
3. Markdown files are filtered and displayed
4. Clicking a file loads it into the editor

### Split Editor Mode

1. User toggles split editor via View â†’ Split Editor or Ctrl+\
2. MainWindow creates second editor pane
3. Layout changes to: Editor 1 | Editor 2 | Preview
4. Content is copied from main editor to second editor
5. Both editors are synchronized - typing in one updates the other
6. Cursor position is preserved during synchronization
7. Preview updates from either editor's content

### Image Insertion via Drag-and-Drop

1. User drags an image file from the file browser
2. MarkdownEditor detects the drag event and checks if it's an image file
3. When dropped, the editor determines the exact text position using `cursorForPosition()`
4. The editor calculates the relative path from the current markdown file to the image
5. Markdown image syntax is automatically inserted at the drop location: `![alt-text](relative/path/to/image.png)`
6. The alt text is set to the image filename (without extension)
7. If the markdown file hasn't been saved yet, an absolute path is used instead
8. Preview automatically updates to show the inserted image

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Qt WebEngine for Preview**: Provides full HTML/CSS rendering capabilities
2. **QSyntaxHighlighter**: Efficient real-time syntax highlighting
3. **Splitter Layout**: Flexible, resizable multi-pane interface
4. **Signal/Slot Architecture**: Loose coupling between components
5. **Static Methods**: CodeHighlighter and EmojiSupport use static methods for stateless operations
6. **Split Editor Synchronization**: Uses focus detection to determine which editor to sync from, preventing infinite loops

## Testing

To test the application:

1. Build the project following README.md instructions
2. Open demo.md to see all features
3. Test editing with live preview
4. Open a folder to test file browser
5. Try different keyboard shortcuts
6. Test full screen mode
7. Test split editor mode (Ctrl+\) with synchronized editing

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Export to PDF/HTML
- Customizable themes
- Configurable keyboard shortcuts
- Find and replace functionality
- Word count statistics
- Markdown extensions (math equations, diagrams)
- Vim keybindings
- Tab support for multiple files
- Diff view in split editor mode
- Independent scrolling in split editors
- Git branch management
- Git merge conflict resolution
