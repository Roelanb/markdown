# Headings Example

This file demonstrates all heading levels in Markdown.

# Heading 1
This is the largest heading, typically used for document titles.

## Heading 2
Used for major sections of your document.

### Heading 3
Used for subsections within major sections.

#### Heading 4
Used for smaller subsections.

##### Heading 5
Used for even smaller subsections.

###### Heading 6
The smallest heading level available.

## Best Practices

- Use only one H1 per document (the title)
- Don't skip heading levels (e.g., don't go from H2 to H4)
- Use headings to create a logical document structure
