# Horizontal Rules

This file demonstrates how to create horizontal rules (dividers) in Markdown.

## Using Hyphens

You can create a horizontal rule using three or more hyphens:

---

Content above the line.

---

Content below the line.

## Using Asterisks

You can also use three or more asterisks:

***

This creates the same visual effect.

***

## Using Underscores

## Practical Usage

Horizontal rules are useful for separating sections of content:

### Section 1: Introduction

This is the introduction section with some content.

---

### Section 2: Main Content

This is the main content section.

---

### Section 3: Conclusion

This is the conclusion section.

---

## Multiple Rules

You can use multiple horizontal rules to create clear visual breaks:

First section of content.

---

Second section of content.

---

Third section of content.

---

Fourth section of content.

## Spacing

Horizontal rules work well with different spacing:

Text immediately before.
---
Text immediately after.

Or with more space:

Text with space before.

---

Text with space after.
