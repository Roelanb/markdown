# Links and Images

This file demonstrates how to create links and embed images.

## Links

### Basic Links

You can create links using this syntax: `[link text](URL)`

Examples:
- [Google](https://www.google.com)
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)

### Links with Titles

Add a title that appears on hover:

[Google](https://www.google.com "Go to Google")

### Reference-Style Links

You can also use reference-style links:

[Link to Google][google]
[Link to GitHub][github]

[google]: https://www.google.com
[github]: https://github.com

### Automatic Links

URLs and email addresses can be automatically converted to links:

https://www.example.com
email@example.com

## Images

### Basic Images

Embed images using: `![alt text](image URL)`

![Placeholder Image](https://via.placeholder.com/400x200)

### Images with Titles

![Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/300x150 "This is a placeholder image")

### Reference-Style Images

![Placeholder Image][placeholder]

[placeholder]: https://via.placeholder.com/350x175

## Combining Links and Images

You can make images clickable by wrapping them in links:

[![Clickable Image](https://via.placeholder.com/200x100)](https://www.example.com)
